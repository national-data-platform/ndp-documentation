# Participating in a NDP Data Challenge

Participating in NDP Data Challenges is an excellent opportunity to collaborate on the development of scientific workflows and explore innovative solutions to complex problems.

If you're looking for a comprehensive example of how to participate in a Data Challenge, and want to try one yourself, check out this [tutorial](https://nationaldataplatform.org/datachallengeonboarding.pdf).

## Joining a Data Challenge

1. **Log in to NDP**
    - Ensure you have an active account and credentials to access the platform.
2. **Explore Challenges**
    - Navigate to the *Education Hub* and select [Explore](https://nationaldataplatform.org/educationhub/explore). Challenges are listed according to their publication dates.
3. **Select a Challenge**
    - Once you find a challenge that interests you, click *Open* to view its details.

4. **Review Information**
    - Carefully read all the details and instructions before joining a challenge. Joining a challenge involves the allocation of resources, so ensure it aligns with your availability and goals.

5. **Join the Challenge**
    - Click *Join Data Challenge* to initiate team creation.
    - By default, you will be added to your team as the first member.
    - If the challenge permits individual participation, you can name your team and proceed.

6. **Add Team Members**
    - Enter the emails of your team members, preferably academic accounts.
    - Ensure that none of the emails are associated with another active team in the same challenge, as this will prevent team creation.

7. **Confirm Participation**
    - Upon successful team creation, you and your team members will become active participants in the challenge.

## Participating in a Data Challenge

Once you join a challenge, follow these steps to maximize your participation:

### Working with Workspaces

- Each team is assigned the challenge's [workspaces](../../workspace/overview.md).
- These workspaces on JupyterHub.
- Teams can enhance their workflows by adding additional data from the catalog and integrating custom code.

### Working on JupyterHub

- Before starting, thoroughly review the instructions for the data challenge and each workspace, especially those related to resource reservations.
- Follow the guidelines to optimize resource usage and align with the challenge's objectives.

**NOTE**: If youâ€™re unfamiliar with NDP workspaces, we highly recommend reviewing this brief [tutorial](../../workspace/set-up.md) to get started.

### Storage

- Each NDP user is allocated **10GB of persistent storage** on JupyterHub labeled as `_User-Persistent-Storage_`. This storage is private and remains available across sessions. 
- When you join a challenge, your team will receive shared storage labeled as `shared-storage-your-team-name`, also with a **10GB capacity**. Any changes made in this folder are visible to all team members and persist across sessions.

#### Best Practices for Shared Storage

1. **Coordinate File Modifications**
    - Shared storage does not support version control, so avoid simultaneous file edits to prevent conflicts.

2. **Optimize Storage Usage**
    - Use shared storage for frequently accessed code or partial data products essential to your workflow.
   
3. **Avoid File Overwrites**
    - Establish clear team protocols for modifying files to minimize risks of accidental data loss.
