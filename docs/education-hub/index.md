# Education Hub

The National Data Platform's Education Hub aims to bring access to advanced computational tools, resources, and AI-ready data, empowering the development of an AI-ready workforce. It enables instructors to deliver resource-intensive courses, facilitate data challenges, and share their expertise through hands-on, open learning resources. This hub is designed to support the growth of practical, skill-based education in AI and computational fields.
