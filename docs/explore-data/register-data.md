# Registering Data in NDP catalog

The NDP Catalog is a metadata registry that allows organizations to share their datasets with the scientific community. By registering datasets, contributors make them discoverable and usable within AI-driven workflows, supporting research across a wide range of fields.

**Note:** The NDP Catalog does not host or store the actual data. Instead, contributors must provide either a direct download URL or an API key that links to externally hosted data.
Before registering your data:

### Before Registering your Dataset

- Prepare your datasetâ€™s metadata. For guidance on each field, including which are required or optional, refer to the [Metadata Schema](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hPWpnMhSymKO1Po5n-aeic7D1wnRiF8n8RmzvgzAfdM/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

- Prepare each of your resources. A dataset may include multiple files. Therefore, make sure that you have a valid access point (URL or API) for each file associated with the dataset.


### Data Registration Process

1 - Go to your Dashboard. In the left panel, click on *Catalogs*, then select *Registration*.

After submitting your data registration form, you will receive a confirmation email acknowledging receipt of your submission. 

Our team will carefully review your dataset to ensure it meets the standards and requirements of the NDP catalog. Please be patient as we complete this review process, as it may take some time.

Once the review is complete, you will receive a second email informing you of the outcome, either accepting or rejecting your dataset for inclusion in the catalog. If your dataset is rejected, it is because it did not meet the necessary standards.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the review process or would like clarification on the status of your submission, please don't hesitate to contact our team for assistance.
