# Set Up Workspace – Tutorial

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to create and configure your first workspace.

To follow along, we’ve provided a [demo GitHub repository](https://github.com/pramonettivega/demo-workspace/tree/main) and registered a [sample dataset](https://nationaldataplatform.org/dataset/weather-station-measurements) in the Data Catalog.

## Setup Instructions

1 - In your Dashboard, click *Add* and select *New Workspace*.

2 - Complete the workspace form. Since this is a demo, feel free to use the sample text provided in the `README.md` of the tutorial repository.

3 - Click *Set Up Module* to proceed.

4 - You may skip the *Learning Objectives* section. This field is primarily used for educational modules in classrooms or data challenges.

5 - In the *Tags* section, type *Machine Learning* and press *Enter* to add it. You can also add relevant *Skills* and *Prerequisites* (especially useful for educational workspaces).

6 - Under Additional Resources, add the following link: `https://www.hpwren.ucsd.edu/`. Press *Enter* to add the link as an additional resource.

7 - Click the *Edit* button next to *Datasets*. This will open a dataset search window.

8 - Search for `HPWREN Weather`, then click *Add* next to the `HPWREN Weather Station Measurements` dataset. Close the window once it's added.

10 - Click Save Module to finalize and save your workspace. You can return at any time to edit your workspace and update its information, datasets, scripts, or resources.

## Next Steps

If you've already created a Research Project, Classroom, or Data Challenge, you can now return to it and attach this newly created workspace.

!!! note
    Any group member with access to the workspace can edit datasets, models, or scripts. However, only the workspace creator can modify the workspace form, including the description, instructions, tags, and additional resources.
