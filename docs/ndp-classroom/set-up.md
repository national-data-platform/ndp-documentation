# NDP Classroom Set-up

The general steps to create and set-up an NDP classroom are the following:

1. Before you can create a classroom, you must have [set up and published your modules](../ndp-modules/module-tutorial.md).
2. Go to the *Educator Portal* within the NDP Education Hub. 
3. Click on *New Classroom*. 
4. Fill in the main module information:
    - **Title of Class:** The title of your class. 
    - **Class Code:** The unique class code used in your institution's program (for example, MSCS123).
    - **Semester/Quarter:** The semester (1st, 2nd/Fall, Spring) or quarter (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer) in which the class is taught.
    - **Year:** The year in which the course is being taken.
     - **Institution:** The name of your institution where the course is being taught. 
5. Be sure to fill in all of the previous fields before clicking on *Set Up Classroom*.
6. Add groups: Students are placed in a classroom as groups. This allows them to work together and share resources within JupyterHub. 
For each group, assign a unique name and a list of student email addresses separated by commas (e.g. student1@ucsd.edu, student2@ucsd.edu, student3@ucsd.edu).
Before adding students to groups, students must log in to NDP so that the system recognizes them as NDP users and allows them to join groups. 

7. Add Modules: Click on *Add a module* to add modules with a due date to your classroom. Your modules must be published before you can select them from the drop down menu.
8. Save your classroom. 
9. Publish your classroom: Before publishing, you can still make changes to your classroom, such as changing the class information, groups, and modules. However, once you have published a classroom, **you cannot make any changes**.
